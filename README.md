# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Crowdfunding

Submitted by: Linda Pescatore

Sea Monster Crowdfunding is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 100 hours spent in total. That is an estimate. I did not know I was supposed to keep track.

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Changed some CSS to improve readability and usability, such as changing some colors and giving buttons shadows and mouseover action that communicates that they are clickable.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had trouble solving the first challenge puzzle; I didn't quite understand the question.
Except for that, the challenges I had were mostly broken links inside the course or a link to an article behind a paywall. Several resources were for other courses and not applicable.
